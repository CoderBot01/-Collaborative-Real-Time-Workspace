# -Collaborative-Real-Time-Workspace
A real-time collaborative workspace where users can create, edit, and share documents, whiteboards, and visualizations with other users. The application supports user authentication, role-based access, and real-time updates, utilizing WebSockets and advanced state management.
Features:
User Management:

User authentication and authorization using JWT.
Role-based access control (Admin, Editor, Viewer).
Profile management (CRUD operations).
Dashboard:

A user-friendly React.js interface with reusable components.
Dynamic routing using React Router and Next.js for server-side rendering.
Document Collaboration:

Real-time document editing using WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO).
Markdown or WYSIWYG editor for rich-text editing.
Canvas Integration:

Visual collaboration using HTML5 Canvas and Konva.js for drawing, annotations, and diagramming.
Map visualizations with Leaflet or Mapbox (e.g., location plotting or route mapping).
Basic 3D visualization with Three.js (optional feature).
Data Visualization:

Create dynamic charts and graphs (using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js).
Options for embedding maps and geospatial data.
Task and Project Management:

Drag-and-drop task boards (e.g., Kanban using libraries like React Beautiful DnD).
Features for setting deadlines, priorities, and notifications.
Performance Optimization:

Lazy loading for components to optimize performance.
Implement debouncing and throttling for API calls and user inputs.
Runtime optimizations with state management tools (like Zustand or React Query).
SEO and Analytics:

Dynamic meta tags for SEO using Next.js.
Google Analytics and Microsoft Clarity integration for tracking user engagement.
Security Best Practices:

Use OWASP API Security guidelines for the backend.
Secure sensitive data with encryption and validation.
